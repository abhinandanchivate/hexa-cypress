# Enterprise-Level Cypress-Only Automation Case Study for Hexaware

## 💼 Client Context: Hexaware Technologies

Hexaware is implementing QA automation for an enterprise eCommerce platform, **HexaShop**, with features such as:

* Multi-role access (Admin, Customer, Vendor)
* Razorpay/Stripe integration
* WebSocket for real-time inventory
* Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance)
* GDPR and localization

## 📆 Objective

Design and deliver a Cypress-only automation framework with:

* End-to-end functional and non-functional test coverage
* Modular, reusable test architecture
* Integrated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
* Cross-team collaboration and stakeholder traceability
* Advanced plugin integrations and accessibility compliance

# 📦 Phase-Wise Plan

## 🧩 Phase 1: Planning & Architecture

### 🎯 Goals:

* Define automation test scope and business priorities
* Identify core modules and use cases for testing
* Establish folder structure, config, and standards
* Determine reporting strategy and tool selection

### 🔧 Technical Stack:

* Cypress v12+ (JavaScript/Node.js)
* cypress-axe, cypress-mochawesome-reporter, file-upload plugins
* GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### 📁 Folder Structure:

```
hexa-cypress-qa/
├── cypress/
│   ├── e2e/{module folders}
│   ├── fixtures/
│   ├── downloads/
│   ├── support/
├── reports/
├── .github/workflows/
├── cypress.config.js
├── package.json
```

## 🧩 Phase 2: Foundation Implementation

### 🎯 Goals:

* Bootstrap project with initial structure and dependencies
* Set up GitHub CI/CD and version control workflows
* Implement helper functions and reusable commands

### 🔨 Actions:

* Write Cypress custom commands (e.g., `cy.loginAs()`)
* Add support files: `commands.js`, `api-helpers.js`, `auth-helpers.js`
* Configure environment variables for different test environments

### ⚙️ Sample Custom Command:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('loginAs', (role) => {
  cy.fixture('users').then(users => {
    const user = users[role];
    cy.request('POST', '/api/login', user).then(res => {
      localStorage.setItem('token', res.body.token);
    });
  });
});
```

### 🔁 GitHub Actions Pipeline:

```yaml
name: Cypress CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v5
        with:
          browser: chrome
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
```

## 🧩 Phase 3: Scenario Implementation

### 🎯 Goals:

* Implement detailed automation flows for all functional areas
* Cover both positive and negative test cases
* Validate API & UI integration using intercepts and fixtures

### 📊 106 Functional Scenarios

#### Authentication & RBAC (12)

* Valid/invalid login, session timeout, 2FA toggle

#### Product Catalog (15)

* Search, filter, sort, responsive rendering, wishlist toggle

#### Cart (12)

* Add/remove items, apply discounts, auto price update

#### Checkout & Payment (10)

* Razorpay fallback to Stripe, address verification, retry flow

#### Orders & Invoice (10)

* View, filter, cancel, reorder, invoice download (PDF validation)

#### Admin Panel (12)

* Product management, bulk upload validation, role access enforcement

#### Accessibility (17)

* ARIA attributes, tabbing, contrast checks (cypress-axe)

#### WebSocket Handling (8)

* Real-time inventory sync, disconnect fallback, multiple tab handling

---

## 🧩 Phase 4: Reporting & Traceability

### 🎯 Goals:

* Enable real-time feedback on test executions
* Track test coverage and business alignment

### 📈 Artifacts:

* HTML reports via Mochawesome
* Screenshots and video recording for failed tests
* Excel traceability matrix (Role → Module → Scenario ID → Status)

---

## 🧩 Phase 5: Final Packaging & Client Delivery

### 🎯 Goals:

* Wrap the project for delivery with documentation
* Ensure client can independently run, maintain, and extend tests

### 📒 Deliverables:

| Type                | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Cypress Framework | Complete, modular, reusable test suite           |
| ✅ CI/CD Pipeline    | GitHub Actions with reporting integration        |
| ✅ Test Reports      | Mochawesome HTML, screenshot logs                |
| ✅ Documentation     | Setup, onboarding, and config management guide   |
| ✅ Excel Matrix      | Test case traceability matrix in tabular format  |
| ✅ Helper Utilities  | Custom command helpers, API intercept logic      |
| ✅ Plugins           | axe-core, file-upload, retry plugin integrations |

### 💡 Optional Enhancements:

* Allure and Percy integrations
* Slack notifications on CI failures
* Docker container for Cypress execution
